Been a while since I did one of my own side-projects. Need the practice.

A simple dungeon-crawling text-based turn-based RPG. Nothing beyond a couple of rooms and a few weapons/monsters for now.

21 April 2022

Restarted this project and taken it back to basics:

-   design a small 10-room location for the player to move around. Until he has been there the locations are unknown and unnamed, and named afterward.
-   directions from each room can be North-East-South-West-Up-Down (some locations will have trapdoors down/skylights up, etc.). Will add combat and story and so on after nailing this first!

Player stats:

-   Health
-   Stamina
-   Agility
-   Skill
